The NIVO slider light plugin includes the JQuery NIVO Slider into your wordpress blog. It does not touch any other gallerys.

== Description ==

The NIVO slider can be used to create a simple gallery in your articles. It does not modify any other images or gallerys.

Have a look at the demos at [nivo.dev7studios.com/demos](http://nivo.dev7studios.com/demos/).

After installing the plugin just write something like:

`<div class="nivoSlider" style="height:200px; width:600px;">
  <img src="/uploads/slide1.jpg" alt="" />
  <img src="/uploads/slide2.jpg" alt="" />
  <a href="http://dev7studios.com">
    <img src="/uploads/slide3.jpg" alt="" title="Go to NIVO" />
  </a>
  <img src="/uploads/slide4.jpg" alt="" title="example caption" />
</div>`

Be sure that all images have the same size. Feel free to edit the plugin's source now as described in the [usage guide](http://nivo.dev7studios.com/).
